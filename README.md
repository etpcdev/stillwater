# Still Water
Build underwater easier in Blockland!

## What does it do?
This mod disables water density and the gravity modifier, effectively making players float in-place underwater rather than rising to the surface.
This should make building underwater a lot easier.

## How to use it?
Enable water on your map, and type /stillWater to toggle it on and off.
You must be a Super Admin to use this tool.

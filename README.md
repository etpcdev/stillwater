# Still Water

Build underwater easier in Blockland!

## What does it do?

This serverside mod disables water density and the gravity modifier, effectively making players float in-place underwater rather than rising to the surface.

This should make building underwater a lot easier.

## How to use it?

Enable water on your map, and type /stillWater to toggle it on and off.

You must be a Super Admin or the Host to use this tool.

## Known Bugs

- Underwater movement in multiplayer games is *sometimes* jittery.
